# orbit-determination

The above files are the culmination of my work during the summer of 2020. The various Python scripts work in conjunction to determin the orbit of a Near-Earth asteroid given photographs of the asteroid on three distinct observations roughly equidistant in time.

Here's a rough sketch of what the project entailed:
• Utilized Vpython, NumPy, Matplotlib, math, and Astropy libraries in Python
• Determine orbit of Near-Earth Asteroid 2011 JT9 using the Method of Gauss with the Scalar Equation of Lagrange iterated hundreds of times by implementing the Monte Carlo Method in Python
• Implemented algorithms including Newton-Raphson as well as simulation techniques like Monte Carlo
• Published results to the Minor Planet Circulars in Center of Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian
